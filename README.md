# Introduction
<p>I am a Physical Chemistry PhD student in the Guenza Group at the University of Oregon focused on Theoretical/Computational Biophysics.  One of my thesis research projects focuses on developing Langevin Dynamics Models which include the effects of rotational coupling.  Including rotational effects allows us to parameterize high-dimensional coarse-grained models with very accurate friction coefficients.<p>

<p>The other thesis research project that I work on focuses on using enhanced sampling methods to study the protein GP32 binding to DNA to gain more insight on the mechanism of DNA replication.<p>

<p>I completed a chemistry and mathematics of physical phenomena double major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I did undergraduate research in Dr. Yesselman's biochemistry laboratory at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focused on writing programs that can draw the secondary structure of RNA.  I also enjoy working on my own individual projects such as modeling electromagnetic waves and modeling molecules.<p>
