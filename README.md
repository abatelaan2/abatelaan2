#Introduction

<p>I am a chemistry and mathematics of physical phenomena double major. I work in Dr. Yesselman's biochemistry laboratory at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focuses on writing programs that can draw the secondary structure of RNA.  I also enjoy working on my own individual projects such as modeling electromagnetic waves and modeling molecules.<p>
